# Tailwind CSS Basic Form Styles

Out of the box, selects, checkboxes, and radios look awful in Tailwind and right now the only way to make them look better is with custom CSS. The goal of this experiment is to provide a better starting point for form elements that is still fairly unopinionated and easy to customize by just layering on additional utilities instead of having to write complicated CSS rules (looking at you checkboxes.)

## Running locally

    cd tailwindcss-form-styles
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install

    # Using Yarn
    yarn
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm run serve

    # Using Yarn
    yarn run serve
    ```

    Now you should be able to see the project running at localhost:8080.
